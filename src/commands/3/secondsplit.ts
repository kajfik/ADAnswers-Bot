Passive : Straight up consecutive EP/min farming runs (afk and offline possible). Works out great for only EP/min farming, will beat out idle overnight with mobile offline setup. Drops off hard at the end of this channel but is usable into the next for a bit.
Active : AM + IP + EP farming, focus required. Setup and always watching required but better than passive.
Idle : AM + IP + EP farm only if you treat this as a check in once every 2 hours type game or are unsure how to setup EP/min farm with passive. If you hate Active this will be the way to go as you need those AM+IP TT eventually.`;
