Whenever you create a new Reality, you will choose (or be given) a new Glyph. These Glyphs provide powerful bonuses, but only while they are equipped.

These glyphs appear in the Glyph tab, in a massive grid called the Glyph Inventory. At the top of the Glyph tab is a series of 3-5 circles, which represent your equipped glyphs. 

On your first Reality, you are guaranteed to receive a ${isADServer ? "<:glyph_power:586607087744843776>" : "**Ω**"} Power Glyph that raises all Antimatter Dimensions to a small power. It is recommended that you equip it immediately.`;

    b) Click and drag the glyph to a slot. At the top of the screen will be 3-5 slots (depending on Reality Upgrades) that you can fill with glyphs. Click on a glyph, hold down the mouse button, and drag it up to one of the empty slots. Attempting to place a glyph in a filled slot will require you to reset the Reality. 
    
To unequip a glyph, you have to click on the "Unequip Glyphs on Reality" button below the equipped glyphs. Then, you have to either complete your reality, or reset it using the "Start this Reality over" button. 

Glyphs that are not equipped have no effect.`;

The rarity of a glyph is given as a percentage, ranging from 0% to 100%. At first, this value will be determined solely by RNGesus. Later on, there will be ways to improve your odds; the first improvement comes as a result of the achievement "Perks of Living", which increases the rarity of all future Glyphs by 1%. 

This rarity is wholly independent from level, and is determined from the moment that you create a new Reality, so you can't savescum them. Your first ever glyph has a rarity of 20%. 

At certain rarity thresholds, the color of your glyph will change. These colors are as follows:

    - Common: 0 - 20%, White
    - Uncommon: 20 - 40%, Green
    - Rare: 40 - 60%, Light Blue
    - Epic: 60 - 70%, Purple

The level of a glyph is calculuated based on 3 (or 4) resources you collect during a Reality. These resources are Eternity Points, Replicanti, and Dilated Time. When you purchase the Reality Upgrade "Measure of Forever", Eternities also become a part of the equation. Only the highest amount reached in a Reality is considered.

Initially, these factors are as follows: 
Eternity Points: \`0.016 * log(EP)^0.5\`
Replicanti: \`0.025 * log(Rep)^0.4\`
Dilated Time: \`0.025 * log(DT)^1.3\`
Eternities: \`0.450 * log(Eternities)^0.5\` (if unlocked)

All of the above factors are then multiplied together. Finally, other bonuses (Such as the number of Reality Upgrade rows you have completed, or achievements such as Royal Flush) are added, and that value, rounded down, is your final Glyph level. 

All this information can be found under "Glyph Level Factors" in the Glyph tab. `;

Glyph Sacrifice allows you to get rid of glyphs that you no longer need, in exchange for a permanent boost based on the glyph's type. Each glyph has a "sacrifice score", based on its level and rarity; when you destroy a glyph, this sacrifice score is added to your total glyph sacrifice for that type.`;

This is a unique, one-of-a-kind glyph that simply exists to bring you joy.

The X% to next shows how close you are to your Glyph level on reality increasing. You can see the exact breakdown of how this is calculated on the Glyphs screen under "Glyph Level Factors". Once it reaches 100% the Glyph level on Reality will increase by 1.

Basically what the % is showing really is the decimal in the Glyph level formula. Say your Glyph level factors are 1.3x from EP, 1.2x from Replicanti and 1.4x from DT, and +1 from a row of upgrades. Overall that's equal to (1.3 x 1.2 x 1.4) + 1 = 3.184. So you would have a Glyph level of 3, and are 18.4% to next Glyph level.`;
